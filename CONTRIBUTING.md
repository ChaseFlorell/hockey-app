## Contribution Guidelines

-----

First of all, thank you for your willingness to contribute to the Hockey-App Windows uploader (unofficial).

### Coding Style

The coding style is quite simple. Please use the Visual Studio defauls for everything (SPACES NOT TABS), and also if you're running Resharper, try your best to get a green checkmark on every file you touch. R#'s default formatting can be acheived on a per-file basis by running <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>f</kbd>.

### Spelling, Documentation, Comments

I'm absolutely open to taking Pull Requests just to fix spelling, documentation, or comments, providing they add value. 

 - Please avoid unnecessary whitespace commits
 - Please don't fix spelling at the expense of breaking the API. Use the `[ObsoleteAttribute]` if you find a method, property, or enum value that is spelled incorrectly, and add the correct spelling beside it.
